This project is a hypothetical $15 million grant proposal.

Introduction:

I propose that Nevada is the best possible recipient for a $5 million grant aimed towards
the promotion of public health. The United Health Foundation states that an investment of $10
per person per year in local community evidence-based programs that are proven to increase
physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking or other tobacco use could save the
country more than $16 billion annually within five years. This can save the U.S. $5.60 for every
$1 invested. Increased spending on public health programs is associated with a decrease in
mortality from preventable causes of death such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and
cancer. Unfortunately, Nevada is the lowest ranked state in public health funding at $46 per
person. With Nevada being the lowest ranked state, the people of the state are at a disadvantage.
As the 4th fastest growing state (U.S. Census), Nevada needs an increase in the promotion
of public health. This will increase the awareness of the people of this fast-growing state and
give a better understanding of the benefits of public health and why government spending
benefits everyone. The promotion of public health is fundamental to the growth, safety, and
prosperity of the state of Nevada. Not only does it directly help the people, but studies show that
the U.S. sees a return on investment and actually saves money in the end. From this information,
I propose that Nevada needs more funding for the promotion of public health.
